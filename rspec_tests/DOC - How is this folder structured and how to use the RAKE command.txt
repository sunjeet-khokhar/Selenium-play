How to run tests using the RAKE command 


1.. All the test specifications are in the "spec" folder and all the page objects are in the "pages"folder
2..  Also in the "spec"you have the spec_helper.rb file that has all the common actions across the test scripts e.g. firing up and quitting a browser at the end of each test

How to run ...
Simple ...

1.Enter this directory 
2. TYpe RAKE on the command line 
3. The framework will look for the "rakefile" , which is present in this case and is programmed to output the test results 
to an html file "rspec_results"
4. The fraemwork will also look for the spec folder and any *_spec.rb files in it and run those tests

another way of running the tests is , goto spec folder 
then type the below in CLI 
rspec --pattern *_spec.rb
